<h6> <span>Project 1 - game design<p>
My negotiated project was to make a game on construct 2. I built a top down progression game were you progress from defeating the enemies. My experience with construct 2 was a top down shooter I made last year.
<p>
My objective for my game was to make a more polished game, has fun mechanic, for it to run smoothly (last year my game ran at 5 fps when things kept spawning) and to make a levelling mechanic. 
The result of game had a few things had intend to put in missing and few new ones such as I didn’t have time to add in the crossbow as instead, I managed to add ability. With all the changes in game I think my game ended in a state I’m happy with.
When planning my game, I thought what mechanic would be enjoyable to use for anyone playing the game and based most of it on what enjoy in games, such being able to see the progression in your character or to unlock a new ability. The process of making my game was trying to put make conditions, actions and variables (variables and conditions/actions go hand in hand, but you don’t need an instant variable to do most conditions) for an example say the player collides with an enemy (which is the condition) it will perform the action and the instance variable will go down by ten and if it hits zero the player will be destroyed. Most of the game is built with these sorts of conditions and variables but this is a very basic example of what you can do with the conditions you can have multiple conditions go on at the same time that all interact. here is a more complex example

There weren’t many problems in my game but of the very few problems there was extremely annoying one, construct 2 would not recognize the licence I had and it made it so I couldn’t work on my game at all so some things. I wanted to get in my game just couldn’t cause I didn’t have enough time and it was just infuriating. Another problem I had, was construct 2 itself the way it works, or I should say doesn’t work, for example, there was an invisible entity that would push the player around and kill you, I tried for hours to fix it but I couldn’t find what was wrong so I kept trying for days and eventually I ran my game and the I didn’t even change anything that day, but it was gone. The thing I’m most proud of in my game was the ability and it worked just how I hoped and more.
